      longDescription: "Spent a year as one of two engineers designing and building the Macys.com micro-frontend architecture, replacing a monolithic frontend so teams could build components in the framework of their choice and release on their own schedules. Built a component harness that let developers work on a component in isolation, with site CSS, core libraries, and common third-party integrations pre-wired, which drove voluntary adoption across roughly eight teams. Components and modules communicated through a shared pub/sub schema and were versioned with semver, with major-version pinning enforced in CI. Cut the product discovery catalog page from a 27-second load to 7 seconds by auditing years of accumulated tag-manager configuration with each tag's owner, removing unused third-party scripts, deferring non-critical scripts, and prioritizing above-the-fold content. Replaced several separate analytics scripts with a Segment-style analytics layer backed by an in-house event store. Kept bundles lean with webpack tree-shaking, bundle analysis, and code splitting, including chunk-based delivery of server-selected A/B test variants. Applied Node.js clustering in the cloud to improve throughput and resilience under enterprise traffic.",
